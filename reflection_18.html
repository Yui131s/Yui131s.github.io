                <p>Today, I learned how to do prototyping in figma in the class. Iâ€™ve never used Figma before I started this course, so it was really helpful to get some basics. I mainly worked on prototyping of mobile and tablet. It was a little bit confusing once I finished designing interactions and there were many interaction arrows, but I needed to figure out what was wrong when I had a problem.  We also created a Kanban board so that we could see who is working on what easily. </p>
