                <p>I checked the brief and I realized I needed to put introduction of myself in homepage. I decided to change my entire blog design structure. I did more research on good structures of blog design. I learned negative space is a key to make the design looks neat and stylish.  As many blog websites were doing, I decided to put some of the journals at the end of the homepage so that the user can see what sorts of journals are like from title and the image without visiting the journal page. For the reflection page, I decided not to put an image and text horizontally and use entire page as one reflection page. This enabled to put a bigger image so that it’s easier to see the snippets of coding. Once I finished designing, I realized it was troublesome that I have to click ‘Journal’ in the nav bar and go to a different article, so I added two buttons to go to the previous/next article at the end of the page.</p>
