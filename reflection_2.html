                <p>For the micro assignment, I needed to emulate an interesting website as much as possible. When I started looking at some website ideas, I remembered that fashion brand websites tend to have quite cool websites, so I looked up websites of “good as gold”, “edit”, and “drole de monsieur”. I chose “drole de monsieur” website as my precedent because the transformation of the website and some moving texts and a cursor with many images caught my attention. I checked the inspect of the website, and at the beginning I had no idea what was going on and it was quite terrifying. However, I could make the website look similar once I found and put the information about the detail of each code like font size, font type, and color of the font. I couldn’t figure out how to get the image of the homepage, so I just took a screenshot of it. I looked up how to insert an image in html page and also how to adjust the size of it. </p>
