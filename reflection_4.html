                <p>The feature branch workflow in ‘git’ makes it easy for the users compared to centralized version control system. A feature branch is “a separate branch in your Git repo used to implement a single feature in your project. When using feature branches, you are creating a new branch for each new feature you develop, instead of just checking in all your changes into the master branch” (Vallandingham, 2015). 
                    The reason why ‘git’ is useful for designers who desire to create quick redesigned prototype is it enables the user to recognize the changes they have made in the work they merged without the risk of functions going wrong. This makes it easy to create a redesign prototype for the designers because the designers don’t need to be worried about whether the base of the coding is working.
                    In addition to this, the user can try out some changes such as replacing some icons by merging other users’ work, ‘git’ allows every person who engages into the project/work to access full repository unlike centralized version control systems such as SVN. The work uploaded by every designer will be saved over the work, so they don’t need to make a new main repository every time someone updated, and this avoids the risk of doing the exact same work twice by different designers. Also, every change the designer made is editable for the other designers. When you use svn, the process of the changes will be erased, and the other designers won’t be able to fix.
