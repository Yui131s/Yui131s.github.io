                <p>There are two things I struggled the most. The first one was coding the top nav bar. At the beginning, I was coding the logo using the border in ‘css’. However, it changes the shape when I change the font size or when I put the logo in the same ‘div’ as the nav bar. I decided to use ‘img’ instead of designing the logo by coding. After that, I had a problem with positioning and display. It took me a while to understand the difference between ‘relative’ and ‘absolute’, and I realized that it doesn’t work if positioning is wrong. Secondly, I struggled with ‘text-align’ in css. As the text shown at the bottom of the image, titles didn’t align center although I put ‘text-align: center;’ in css. It was because I put ‘absolute’ as positioning not ‘relative’. I thought it would be aligning to the image above by putting ‘absolute’. </p>
