                <p>It was my first time to working with coding like ‘html’. I learned what the difference is between ‘html’ and ‘css’. Although both of them are languages to design a website, ‘Html’ is used to design the basics for a website, and ‘css’ is used for aesthetics by controlling the style of the website such as sizing, layout, font, and color. It was interesting for me that there are two different ways to code ‘css’, which are internal style sheet and external style sheet. For the internal style sheet, it would be filed inside of ‘html’ page. On the other hand, the external style sheet would be filed as a ‘css’ page and links it with html page. By separating files by languages, each page looks neat and simple.</p>
