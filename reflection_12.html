                <p>After I watched the lecture, I copied a flexbox file from tutorial 5 and started editing class names in a html file. There was way more components in the flexbox file than the example one, so I was a bit confused. It was really hard to tell if I can classify into the same name or not, so I didn’t change the class names much. I apply names into ‘css’ and ‘js’, but I put the wrong name so that only half of the website worked. After I fixed that problems, I found out the order of the paragraphs were not correct anymore and I couldn’t find out why. In addition, the color didn’t change around the table at the bottom. I forgot to delete some background colors, so I thought that was why, but it wasn’t. I didn’t name table content in ‘js’ correctly. I could fix the color, but not the order of the paragraph. </p>
