                <p>I added a hover effect on the top nav bar so that it’s easier for the user to recognize that you can click on them. I put an underline while hovering, but it looked a little bit too much to go with the simplicity of the website, so I decided to use ‘expand’ effect because it clearly demonstrates it’s clickable but simple. After I understand how to use hover effect, I decided to use hovering effect on the button for each journal image. When the user hovers over an image of an article, ‘read more’ button will show up and it implies it’s a clickable button by ‘expand’ effect and changing color of the box. Since last blog design, I developed the user flow. I also added Media Quary for mobile. When the width is less than 600px, it starts changing. I thought it would be really hard, but it was quite straightforward, so I could finish without any problems. </p>
