                <p>When I opened up my precedent website, they changed the image and color on the homepage, so I did the exact same process of inserting an image on a ‘html’ page. I looked up how to change the position of the image, and I found that there are several different types of positioning; fixed, relative, and absolute. However, I couldn’t figure out how to apply that positioning coding into the ‘html’ page. During a tutorial, I asked the tutor about it and he told me to use “div” to make the page organized and also type positioning code in ‘css’ not ‘html’. 
                    He also told me I don’t need to type each code one by one, but just typing the key word such as a, div, and li. After I started understanding the meaning of coding, it wasn’t scary to look at the inspect of website anymore and it was quite interesting to read an inspection of websites. 
                    One of the lists of the website was a horizontal list, and I didn’t know how to do that so I looked up and I found if I typed “display:inline;” in css, it would make the selected list from vertical to horizontal. 
                    After I figured out how to do positioning and typing vertically and horizontally, I could put all contents where it should be in my precedent website although I couldn’t find out some advanced coding like cursor with many images.
                    Through this assignment, I could learn more basic coding and I realized how it felt good after figuring out things what I didn’t know.
